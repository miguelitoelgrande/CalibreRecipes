This ia a little collection of my calibre news feeds and other hacked recipes to create some eBooks/Periodicals 
for offline reading on my mobile devices.

Calibre has a fantastic mode to create eBooks/Periodicals in Kindle format or ePub from RSS feeds.
(The ePub output has very convenient HTML navigation features, so converting from ePUB to AZW3 sometimes makes sense!)

Over the time, I have modified some built-in recipes which seemed to be outdated or to strip some infos I do not need.
Plus, I've added some special recipes for my own purposes, for example
- Importing "ScrapBook" (the Firefox add-in) into Calibre (as a "News feed")
- Extracting blogspot-blogs
- News sources for Tagesanzeiger, 20min.ch,...
